Module Getopt::Plus:

    Getopt wrapper with standard options, help system and more

Description:

    This package provides a way to set up executables with standard options
    for help (--help, --longhelp, --man), logging (--verbose, --debug, and
    more), keeping the relevant documentation in one place instead of spreading
    it liberally across your source file(s).  It provides a common behaviour
    for your executables with minimum effort.
